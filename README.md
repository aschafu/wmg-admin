# Web Molecular Graphics Organisation

This repo is here to help organise the Web Molecular Graphics (WMG) organisation brought together in the NII Shonan Meeting 2016.

One of the first tasks will be to decide how best to fill in the following blanks...

## What are we trying to achieve?

 * help coordinate numerous efforts to provide molecular visualisation
 * develop guidelines / good practices for UI
 * connect users to developers to create better visualisations
 * ... TODO

## How to we plan to do that?

 * face-to-face meetings (Shonan, Dagstuhl, ...?)
 * publications
 * sharing code
 * ... TODO

## What other things should be here...?

 * ... TODO

## GitHub 'admins'

This group is currently being organised through GitHub - contact the following if you have any query related to the WMG organisation or GitHub:

 * Bosco Ho (@boscoh)
 * Ian Sillitoe (@sillitoe)
 * Jon Wedell (@jonwedell)

Note: the ideal way of getting in touch is by [raising an issue](https://github.com/web-molecular-graphics/wmg-admin/issues/new) against this repo

* **What is a Shonan Meeting?**

    "NII International Meetings, following the well-known Dagstuhl Seminars, aim to 
    promote informatics and informatics research at an international level, by providing 
    yet another world’s premier venue for world-class scientists, promising young researchers, 
    and practitioners to come together in Asia to exchange their knowledge, discuss their 
    research findings, and explore a cutting-edge informatics topics.
    
    "The meetings are held in Shonan Village Center (near Tokyo) which offers a combination 
    of facilities for conferences, trainings, lodging in a resort-like setting. The friendly 
    and open atmosphere is to promote a culture of communication and exchange among the 
    meeting participants. The NII International Meetings are managed by National 
    Institute of Informatics (NII) in Japan."

* **Web Molecular Graphics?**

    "There is a rapidly growing wealth of molecular structure data that has been derived 
    from experimental methods (e.g., X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy) 
    and are freely provided from the international database PDB, Protein Data Bank, as well as 
    computational methods, such as molecular dynamics. These data provide scientists today 
    with unprecedented insight into a wide range of molecular phenomena, for example protein 
    function, biological membrane transport, or material properties.
    
    "The amount of data is steadily growing in size as well as in complexity: more protein structures, 
    larger protein structures (big complexes) and time-resolved data, such as molecular dynamics 
    trajectories. In the near future, these data may increase in scale to include, for example, 
    complex cellular machineries and whole living cells. A key challenge is to make all of these 
    data accessible to scientists, in ways that enable interpretation and the generation of new research insights.
    
    "Fortunately, nowadays almost all scientists – even students – have easy access to computer graphics 
    capabilities powerful enough to show a wide variety of molecular structures. With modern bandwidth 
    speeds, it is even feasible to stream complex, interactive molecular graphics into simple devices 
    such as an iPad or iPhone, via GPU-rendering on a remote server. Thus, it is now possible to depict 
    and explore 3D models in regular browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. 
    This allows to bring 3D molecular visualisation tools to non-expert end users without the need to 
    install specialised software. However, in times of a steadily growing amount of data, improved 
    visualization methods and tools are urgently needed, which can make the more complex data 
    accessible and interpretable."
